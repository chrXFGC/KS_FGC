Analysis of fetus KS gonads
======
This repository contains the scripts used for in the manuscript: How the extra X chromosome impairs the development of male fetal germ cells.

This repository contains a collection of scripts used for the analysis of Smart-seq2, DNA methylome, RNA SNP calling, 10x Genomics, Stereo-seq data, and Clustering of XIST signals. You can find them in their respective folders. The Smart-seq2 library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X ten platform. The 10Ã— Genomics library was sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq instrument. The Single-cell Trio-seq library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X ten platform. The stereo-seq library was sequenced on the DNBSEQ-T10 platform. All reads were aligned to the hg19 human genome. The barcode sequences used for Smart-seq2 can be found in the Smart-seq2 folder.
